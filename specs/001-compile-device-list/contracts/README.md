# Contracts (Phase 1) - Compile Device List

This feature does not introduce external service/API contracts. Device detection uses existing platform enumeration APIs.

## Scope
- No REST, GraphQL, IPC changes.
- Internal-only data embedding.

## Rationale
Runtime JSON configuration removed; no replacement protocol needed.

## Future
If remote device catalogs or update channels are added, define contract schemas here.
